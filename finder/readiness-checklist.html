                                    <p>Unfortunately, sometimes businesses are made aware of a grant opportunity too late [Stats about % of rushed submissions that are incomplete]. </p>
                                    
                                    <p>It is challenging to write a clear, concise and compelling application when in a rush. Consider the risk of wasted business time, effort and even money on an unsuccessful application that was low quality or incomplete.</p>

                                    <p>Grants or programs will generally have criteria your business must meet to be eligible. To determine your eligibility, you may be asked to provide information about: </p>

                                        <li>your business's annual turnover </li>
                                        <li>how long you've been running your business </li>

                                    <p>Grant applications are much easier to write if you have the documentation readily available.

                                    <p>If you don't have the documentation, what steps are needed to create them? Ensure you factor this time into your grant application timeline.</p>

                                    <p>For competitive grants, make your submission is easy to read so the assessor can see: </p>

                                        <li>Isn't repetitive: Each criterion seeks different information - don't repeat the same thing </li>
                                        <li>Adds quality information - rather than quantity. Assessors read many applications, so if yours has unnecessary detail, it makes it harder for them to assess </li>
